This tool visualizes the sequential process of a trained agent. The data has to pre-processed with `eval_vis.py` for a particular trained model (available in `../code/agent_rl/eval_vis.py`).

Open `index.html` in your browser to start (tested on Chrome). To select a different dataset, edit `index.html` and uncomment a particular dataset you want (bottom of the file).
